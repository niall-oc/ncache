ncache

Simple caching decorator that allows you to use redis like a cache.

from ncache import cachable

@cachable(seconds=500)
def sum(a,b):
    return a+b

sum(4,5) # an expensive calculation indeed :-)

9 is cached

By default the function name and arguments are conconated to create the key and all values are pickled before adding to the cache

@cachable() # sets a key permanently

@cachable(seconds=300) # caches for 300 seconds

@cachable(key_name='mykey') # sets a specific key_name

@cachable(pickled=True, hash_keys=False) # Will pickle values before storing them but no hash the key name.  This is the default behaviour

@cachable(prefix="STORE1") # Will prefix all keys with the plain text STORE1. This is handy for group selecting ranges of keys on the redis-cli.  Prefixes are never hashed for this reason so you can do your dev work.

    @cachable()
        def sum(a, b):
        return a + b

By default the key name is the function name _ *args _ **kw.  So sum(3, 4) is caches as key "sum_(3, 4)_{}"
